        <h2>Think more efficiently</h2>
        <p>I would say my biggest pet peeve related to the industry would be people focusing on technology instead of design, standards instead of users, and validation rather than innovation. Web standards and best practices are noble goals, but all too often in our community people forget they are a means to an end, not the end itself.</p>

        <h2>Simplicity is not the goal</h2>
        <p>Always read with a pen in hand. The pen should be used both to mark the text you want to remember and to write from where the text leaves you. Think of the text as the starting point for your own words. Designers can create normalcy out of chaos; they can clearly communicate ideas through the organising and manipulating of words and pictures.</p>
